These programs are for running the LM analysis on a video. I copy them into
the folder where I am analyzing the experimental data.

details_hd5f.pro - is a program where you can input all the
		 experimental details which are saved to a hd5f file

getbackground.pro - creates a background image from a video

dhmstream_mp.pro - analyses the holograms in a video

rundhmstream.pro - collects information from details_hd5f.pro and then
		 runs getbackground.pro and dhmstream_mp.pro
